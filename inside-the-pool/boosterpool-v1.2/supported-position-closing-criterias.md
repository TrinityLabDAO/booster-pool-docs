# 2⃣ Supported position closing criterias

Currently, bot support the following position closing criterias:

1. “NEVER”. Current position will never be closed, under any circumstances it will stay at the same ranges (ticks). Useful, for example, for a pair of stablecoins.
2. “AUTO”. Rebalancing will be initiated if price is outside of the position.
