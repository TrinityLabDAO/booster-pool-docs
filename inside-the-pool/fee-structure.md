# Fee structure

BoosterPool takes a 10% fee on the commissions earned within its liquidity pool. This fee might seem substantial, but it's a crucial part of the platform's sustainability and growth. What sets BoosterPool apart is its transparent and strategic allocation of this fee:

### 6% to the Treasury

The largest portion of the fee, 6%, is directed towards the Treasury. This allocation is a testament to BoosterPool's commitment to its long-term development. The funds channeled into the Treasury are earmarked for project development, improvements, and innovations.

### 3% to the BuyBack Fund

A significant portion of the fee, 3%, is devoted to the BuyBack Fund. This fund serves a crucial role in stabilizing the BoosterPool economy. The BuyBack Fund is used to repurchase BoosterPool tokens from the market. This practice helps maintain the token's value by reducing its circulating supply, ultimately benefiting token holders and enhancing overall confidence in the project.

### 1% for LP-Strategist Incentives

The remaining 1% of the fee is allocated to a fund designed to incentivize LP-strategists. BoosterPool recognizes the importance of its community and encourages the development of top-performing strategies. The strategies that prove successful will be integrated into the vault interface, providing LP strategists with the opportunity to earn additional rewards. This system not only rewards innovation but also fosters a collaborative atmosphere where community members actively contribute to the platform's growth.

### Conclusion

BoosterPool's complex fee structure sets it apart in the competitive DeFi landscape. By allocating fees strategically, BoosterPool ensures the sustainability and growth of its ecosystem while also rewarding its community members. Whether you're a liquidity provider, LP strategist, or token holder, there are opportunities for you to benefit from BoosterPool's approach.
