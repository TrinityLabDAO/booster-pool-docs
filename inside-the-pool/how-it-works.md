# 2âƒ£ How it works

### **How the strategy works**

Each strategy starts from selecting a pool (tokens part and commission), used for backtesting. But besides that each strategy has a set of start parameters:

* Select a number of start positions, its width (in tick spaces) and amount of concentrated liquidity in tokens.
* Select a criteria for position rebalancing. Such criterias can include:
  * Rebalance position, if current relative token price is outside of the position soft or hard ranges (see below).
  * Rebalance position, if given number of blocks passed from last rebalancing, etc.
* Select a data range (or other data criteria) used for strategy evaluation.

Each of these parameters can be set independently for each position.\
A strategy input must also include a small set of technical parameters, such as precision of floating-point calculation. Note that real Uniswap V3 uses integer calculations.

### **Direct and reverse prices**

A price of accounts can be calculated according to uniswap math. Basically, a price is a ratio between amounts of two tokens, namely - X and Y. In real pool X can be, for example, USDT and Y - ETH. The important part is that while end-user results and input parameters can be expressed in both Y/X (direct price) and X/Y (reverted price), the software itself calculates all the results using only direct price. It is important for working with soft ranges (see below). We use price information only at the end of block number, because our research leads to the conclusion that it is sufficient[\[6\]](information-sources.md).

### **Basic position parameters**

There are three basic position parameters: upper and lower bounds and input liquidity. The latter is obvious, and can be set using both tokens in arbitrary proportion. Correct proportion of tokens will be calculated automatically, according to uiswap math.

Each position has an upper and lower bound that are set in ticks. But not every tick can be used to place a position bound. According to Uniswap V3 math, a subset of ticks that can be used for this depends on the amount of fee that Uniswap V3 gives for that pool and it is determined by so-called tick space (see table 1).

#### **Table 1. Tick spaces for different pool commissions.** <a href="#table1" id="table1"></a>

| Pool commission | Tick space |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| 0.0005          | 10         |
| 0.003           | 60         |
|  **** 0.01      | 200        |

If the tick number can be divided without excess to tick space, then this tick can be used to place position top or bound. Such a tick is called base tick in our software. For the case of strategy assessment, location of each position is determined according to relative tokens price at the block, where the position is started. So each location of each position can be set using two numbers:

* Position width in tick spaces.
* Position delta (shift from tick, corresponding to start position price).

Note that ticks can be negative, and that direction of price and ticks scales can be different. Moreover, the relation between prices and ticks is not linear. Calculation of tick, corresponding to given price is done, according to Uniswap v3 whitepaper. So each part a position is placed (on strategy start or after rebalancing) its position will be set according to given price, width and delta (see Figure 1).
