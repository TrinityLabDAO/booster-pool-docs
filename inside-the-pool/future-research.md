One of the limitations of the current version of Uniswap V3 evaluator is that it does not take into account a new paradigm of working with Uniswap V3 positions - Uniswap V3 position as Perpetual Option [\[12\]](information-sources.md). From this point of view, using a special type of liquidity managing between pools users can achieve the same profit curves that take place for call and put options [\[13\]](information-sources.md). That allows the use of classical math to assist in selecting best positions parameters, such as the widely used Black–Scholes model.&#x20;

Another approach to improve Uniswap V3 evaluator capabilities is to automatically select the optimal strategy parameters. The most obvious approach is brute force - calculate strategy profit for all possible values in given ranges, but for most tasks this approach is impractical. Using tools from decision theory the amount of calculation can be minimized, but this approach requires a lot of R\&D to be done.[ **** ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14232)****
