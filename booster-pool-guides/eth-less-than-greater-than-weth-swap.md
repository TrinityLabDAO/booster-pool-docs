# â†” ETH <-> wETH swap

Uniswap V3 pools use wrapped ETH. To get it, you need to swap ETH for WETH.

{% hint style="info" %}
Wrapped Ether (wETH) is a token pegged to Ether (ETH). wETH is used by several platforms and DApps that support ERC-20 tokens. While ETH is used to pay for network transaction fees, it doesn't have the same functionality as ERC-20 tokens.

You can easily convert ETH into wETH through a process known as _wrapping_. You can also convert WETH back into ETH at any time. Both wrapping and unwrapping follow a 1:1 ratio, meaning there are no extra costs apart from the transaction fees.
{% endhint %}

You can wrap your ETH using a booster pool wrapping smart contract, which will store your ETH and give you back exactly the same amount of wETH. Use **Wrap ETH** tab on the pool's page:

Enter the amount of ETH you want to "wrap" into the input box and click **Wrap ETH**. After that, the MetaMask confirmation window will appear. Click **Confirm** to proceed.

Note that you need to leave a small amount of ETH to pay the transaction fees.

If you want to get ETH in exchange for wETH, click on the arrows, and the direction of the exchange will change:

Now you can unwrap your wETH and receive ETH:

![unwrap wETH](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

Let's unwrap some wETH. You need to enter the desired amount of wETH and click **Unwrap wETH**. After that, the MetaMask confirmation window appears. Click **Confirm** to proceed:

Congratulations, you have successfully performed the wrap - unwrap operation for ETH.
