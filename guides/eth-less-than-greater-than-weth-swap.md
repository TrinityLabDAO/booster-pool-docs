# ETH<->WETH swap

Uniswap V3 pools use wrapped ETH. To get it, you need to swap ETH for WETH.

{% hint style="info" %}
Wrapped Ether (wETH) is a token pegged to Ether (ETH). wETH is used by several platforms and DApps that support ERC-20 tokens. While ETH is used to pay for network transaction fees, it doesn't have the same functionality as ERC-20 tokens.

You can easily convert ETH into wETH through a process known as _wrapping_. You can also convert WETH back into ETH at any time. Both wrapping and unwrapping follow a 1:1 ratio, meaning there are no extra costs apart from the transaction fees.
{% endhint %}

You can wrap your ETH using any of third-party services such us MetaMask, Uniswap and etc.
