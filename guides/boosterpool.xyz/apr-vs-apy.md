# APR vs APY

The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is the interest rate charged over a year, excluding any fees.

It does not factor in the effect of compounding that can occur when profits are reinvested. For example,

{% hint style="info" %}
investing $100 with a 100% APR would yield a profit of $100 after one year.
{% endhint %}

However, when profits are regularly reinvested, the interest can compound, resulting in an Annual Percentage Yield (APY).

The frequency of compounding can greatly affect the difference between APR and APY. The more frequent the compounding, the greater the discrepancy between the two rates.

### How does APY work?

APY, which stands for annual percentage yield, is a measure of the returns offered by a specific investment.

Unlike simple interest, APY takes into account the effect of compounding interest, which provides a more precise estimate of your actual returns.

{% hint style="info" %}
Investments that yield 1% or more on a daily basis can potentially generate high APYs in the thousands of percentage points.
{% endhint %}

This is because the interest earned is continually reinvested and compounded on larger sums of money, such as in a liquidity pool rewards program.
