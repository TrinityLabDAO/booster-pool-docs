# Autocompound

BoosterPool's autocompound feature is designed to optimize your profits and streamline your investment strategy without requiring any manual intervention. With autocompound, the commissions earned from your investments are automatically reinvested, allowing your capital to grow continuously.

When you added liquidity in any vault on BoosterPool, you earn commissions from each trade in setted range in liquidity pool. Instead of manually reinvesting these commissions, the autocompound feature takes care of the process for you. It automatically reinvests your earned commissions back into the liquidity pool, compounding your returns over time. By reinvesting the commissions, autocompound maximizes the growth potential of your investment. It allows you to benefit from the power of compounding, where your earnings generate additional returns, which are then reinvested to generate even more earnings. This compounding effect can significantly enhance your overall profitability in BoosterPool.

With autocompound in BoosterPool, you can enjoy a hands-off approach to maximizing your profits. It simplifies your investment journey, allowing you to focus on other aspects of your financial strategy while your earnings are automatically reinvested for long-term growth.
