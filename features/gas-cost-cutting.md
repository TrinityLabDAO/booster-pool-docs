# Gas cost-cutting

In BoosterPool, gas cost-cutting is a key focus to enhance efficiency. BoosterPool achieves gas savings through direct interaction with liquidity pools, eliminating the need for third-party contracts or intermediaries. By directly interacting with the pools, unnecessary gas fees associated with additional transactions or interactions are avoided. This streamlined approach ensures that your transactions are executed efficiently and cost-effectively.

By reducing gas costs, BoosterPool enables users to maximize their returns and minimize unnecessary expenses. This allows you to allocate more of your capital towards liquidity provision and investment opportunities, increasing the potential for higher yields.
